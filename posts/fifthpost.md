## People who believe COVID-19 conspiracy theories tend to struggle with scientific reasoning, study finds
Individuals with a better grasp of scientific reasoning are less likely to fall prey to false conspiracy theories about the COVID-19 pandemic, 
according to new research published in the Journal of Health Psychology.

“At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic there was too much uncertainty and confusion regarding the best measures to protect oneself against the coronavirus,”
 said study author Vladimira Cavojova of the Centre for Social and Psychological Sciences at the Slovak Academy of Sciences.

In the study, which was conducted about a week after the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Slovakia,
 783 participants were asked to indicate how much they agreed with various coronavirus conspiracy beliefs,
 such as “SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus) is a biological weapon created to eliminate the overcrowded human population” and “COVID-19 (coronavirus) is only a fabrication,
 it is an ordinary flu which pharmaceutical companies rebranded to increase the sales of drugs.”
 
 The researchers found that those who strongly endorsed the coronavirus conspiracy beliefs tended to score low on the test of scientific reasoning.
 Belief in coronavirus conspiracy theories, in turn, was associated with a reduce willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.
